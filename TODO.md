# TODO

### Now
- Refactor (eliminate crazy nesting)
- Finish all that error handling.

### Future
- Are there modules we can use to better interface with npm / nvm-windows?
- Possibly add ability to execute nvm commands. See [this Grunt task](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-nvm).
- Reinstalling dependencies when version of npm changes? Might be tricky.

### Possible v1.0 changes
- Change `alwaysInstall` to `autoInstall`.
- Change task name to something simpler, like `nvm`?
- Decide how to feel about the `nvm` option.
